# Backlog

This is the catalog of things that would probably make sense to do in the future.

## Assigned

### L1: Implement Class for Linear Matroids

Implement a version of the matroid typeclass that represents linear matroid over
arbirary fields. (assignee: I.A.)

## Unassigned

### B1: `Data.Matroid.Graphic.Internal` `Forrest` cleanup

Check whether there is a more canonical way to represent the `Forrest` data type
used to determine components in undirected graphs. Also, check whether we can
utilize the `fgl` library for this purpose instead of rolling our own ad-hoc
implementation.
